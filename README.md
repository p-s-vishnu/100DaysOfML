### Day 0 : 16 July 2018

**Today's Progress** : Completed 3rd Day (Day 2 Challenges) of "10 Days of Statistics" in Hackerrank

**Thoughts** : Learnt about *Compound*, *Mutually Exclusive* and *Collective Events*. [Reference](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-mcq-1/tutorial)

### Day 1 : 17 July 2018

**Today's Progress** : Completed 4th Day (Day 3 Challenges) of "10 Days of Statistics" in Hackerrank

**Thoughts** : In *Conditional Probablity*, we are only looking for the probability that the second event occurs in a given state. *Eg:* While tossing a coin twice, probability that you get two heads and the probability that you get head in 2nd toss given that 1st one was a head both are not equal.

### Day 2 : 18 July 2018

**Today's Progress** : Started with *Binomial Distribution* and I think I will hav to put in more time to assimilate the concepts.

**Resources** : [Random Variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variable), [Binomial Experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_trial), [Bernoulli Random Variable and Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_distribution), [Binomial Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution) and [Cumulative Probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function).
