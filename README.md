### Day 1 : 17 July 2018

**Today's Progress** : Completed Day 3 Challenges of "10 Days of Statistics" in Hackerrank

**Thoughts** : In *Conditional Probablity*, we are only looking for the probability that the second event occurs in a given state. *Eg:* While tossing a coin twice, probability that you get two heads and the probability that you get head in 2nd toss given that 1st one was a head both are not equal.

### Day 2 : 18 July 2018

**Today's Progress** : Started with *Binomial Distribution* and I think I will hav to put in more time to assimilate the concepts.

**Resources** : 
* [Random Variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variable) 
* [Binomial Experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_trial)

***
### Day 3 : 19 July 2018

**Today's Progress** : Completed Hackerrank Day 4 problems.

**Thoughts**  : *The geometric distribution is a *special case* of the negative binomial distribution that deals with the number of Bernoulli trials required to get a success*

**Resources** : [Negative Binomial distribution & Geometric distribution](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-geometric-distribution-1/tutorial)

***
### Day 4 : 20 July 2018

**Today's Progress** : Completed 2 problems of Day 5 Challenges

**Thoughts**  : Poisson probability, which is the probability of getting exactly *k* successes when the average number of successes is *lambda*. Poisson Distribution condition, events are occuring randomly and independently. 

**Resources** : 
* [Poisson Distribution](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-poisson-distribution-1/tutorial)

***
### Day 5 : 21 July 2018

**Today's Progress** : Completed Day 5 Challenges

**Thoughts**  : Normal distribution could have been taught better at Hackerrank. Referred khan academy for better understanding.
* Normal distribution is a function that represents the distribution of many random variables as a symmetrical bell-shaped graph
* Cumulative distributive function is a function which helps to compute the area under curve of probability density function.Eg: It helps in finding probability of getting value less than 'x'.

***
### Day 6 : 22 July 2018

**Today's Progress** : Completed Day 6 Challenges

**Thoughts** : 
* *Central Limit Theorem*, it states that if you have a population with mean 'mew' and standard deviation 'sigma' and take sufficiently large random samples from the population with replacement , then the distribution of the sample means will be approximately normally distributed.
* *z-score*, it is a factor telling you with what probability you land in an interval of z standard deviations away from the mean (in both directions)

***
### Day 8 : 24 July 2018

**Today's Progress** : Completed Day 7 leftovers and Day 8 challenge,also worked on Brilliant's conditional probability.

**Thoughts** : Solving Linear regression problem was a bliss. But I was stuck in the pearson correlation challenge for regression line, eventually checked the discussion forum.

***
### Day 10 : 26 July 2018

**Today's Progress** :Initialized udacity's machine learning project. Installed required libraries (scikit-learn, nltk, scipy, numpy and sklearn) and downloaded the dataset. 

**Thoughts** :It seems pretty fun. The course includes 16 lessons and one final project and I Expect to complete it within a month.

**Link of work** : [Commit](https://github.com/qwertypsv/udacity/commits?author=qwertypsv&since=2018-07-25T18:30:00Z&until=2018-07-26T18:30:00Z)

***
### Day 11 : 27 July 2018

**Today's Progress** : Completed Naive bayes assignment, acheived SQL level 4 badge and solved another section brilliants' conditional probability.

**Thoughts** : The assignment seemed pretty intimidating at first but soon it became pretty fun. I will need more practice of advanced queries in order to achieve the final badge at Hackerrank.

* [Commit](https://github.com/qwertypsv/udacity/commits?author=qwertypsv&since=2018-07-26T18:30:00Z&until=2018-07-27T18:30:00Z) 
* [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/qwertypsv)

***
### Day 12 : 28 July 2018

**Today's Progress** : Started SVM also solving few probability questions and understanding concepts better.

**Thoughts** : Switched from Time based work to Task based approach it is taking a lot of time but I am indeed delving deep into each topic. Conditional probability helps in deriving an *inference* from *cause - effect* model, pretty much reverse relation.Revised two laws - Multiplicative and Law of total probability.

* [Video - Monty hall problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L30HPgryd6I)
* [Video - Conditional and Bayes' rule](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TluTv5V0RmE)

***
### Day 13 : 29 July 2018

**Today's Progress** : Completed Udacity's SVM and started with Decision Tree,also completed SQL course by Stanford.

**Thoughts** :

* NULL values in database may have unknown behaviour. E.g: while displaying distinct values with null you might get a blank value too, but when you count the distinct values it will skip the null values
* I Liked many questions from the SQL course, one of those were

> For all cases where the same reviewer rated the same movie twice and gave it a higher rating the second time, 
> return the reviewer's name and the title of the movie.

* Will be soon writing an article covering solutions of SQL - Stanford Online

***
### Day 14 : 30 July 2018

**Today's Progress** : Completed Module 1/9 of Brilliant's Artificial Neural Network and Working on decision trees.

**Thoughts** : 

* A neuron in ANN behaves similar to brain's neuron, it only *fires* if it is above a given threshold.

**Resources**: [Decision Tree - scikit learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html)

***
### Day 15 : 31 July 2018

**Today's Progress** : Completed Decision tree assignment, started with KNN

**Thoughts**:

* Requires little data preparation
* The cost of using the tree (i.e., predicting data) is logarithmic
* Decision tree learners create biased trees if some classes dominate. It is therefore recommended to balance the dataset prior to fitting with the decision tree.

**Resources**: 
* [Decision Tree Classifier - Scikit](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html#sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier)

***
### Day 16 : 1 August 2018

**Today's Progress** : Tried terrain classification problem with KNN

**Thoughts**: 
* KNN is analogous to a voting system, the votes of the nearnest neighbour are accounted in order to predict the class of test point. 

**Resources**: 
* [Analytics Vidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/03/introduction-k-neighbours-algorithm-clustering/)

*** 
### Day 17 : 2 August 2018
**Today's Progress** : Adaboost classifier

**Thoughts**
* Ensemble method, meta-algorithms that combine several machine learning techniques into one predictive model in order to decrease variance (bagging), bias (boosting), or improve predictions (stacking)
* AdaBoost, short for Adaptive Boosting, is a machine learning meta-algorithm formulated by Yoav Freund and Robert Schapire, who won the 2003 Gödel Prize for their work. It can be used in conjunction with many other types of learning algorithms to improve performance.
* It is a meta-estimator(usually built from decision trees) that begins by fitting a classifier on the original dataset and then fits additional copies of the classifier on the same dataset but where the weights of incorrectly classified instances are adjusted such that subsequent classifiers focus more on difficult cases.

*** 
### Day 18 : 3 August 2018
**Today's Progress** : Random forest

**Thoughts**
* Random forests or random decision forests are an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks, that operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) 

**Resources**
* [Random forest - sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html)
* [Video - Augmented startups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_2LkhMJcfY)

*** 
### Day 19 : 4 August 2018
**Today's Progress** : Enron dataset - Udacity

**Thoughts**

* Enron scandal is pretty interesting case to study, creating a classifier which can correctly identify a new person as 'POI' (Person Of Interest) will be challenging.
* The biggest challenge is lack of data, artificially adding new data might affect the classifier adversely
