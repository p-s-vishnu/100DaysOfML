# 100DaysOfML
I am taking up the challenge to to Learn  Machine Learning at least an hour everyday!!  

## Daily Log

### Day 0 : 16 July 2018

**Today's Progress** : Completed Day 2 Challenges of "10 Days of Statistics" at Hackerrank

**Thoughts** : Learnt about *Compound*, *Mutually Exclusive* and *Collective Events*.

### Day 1 : 17 July 2018

**Today's Progress** : Completed Day 3 Challenges of "10 Days of Statistics" in Hackerrank

**Thoughts** : In *Conditional Probablity*, we are only looking for the probability that the second event occurs in a given state. *Eg:* While tossing a coin twice, probability that you get two heads and the probability that you get head in 2nd toss given that 1st one was a head both are not equal.

### Day 2 : 18 July 2018

**Today's Progress** : Started with *Binomial Distribution* and I think I will hav to put in more time to assimilate the concepts.

**Resources** : 
* [Random Variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variable) 
* [Binomial Experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_trial) 
* [Bernoulli Random Variable and Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_distribution) 
* [Binomial Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution) 
* [Cumulative Probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function). 

***
### Day 3 : 19 July 2018

**Today's Progress** : Completed Hackerrank Day 4 problems.

**Thoughts**  : *The geometric distribution is a *special case* of the negative binomial distribution that deals with the number of Bernoulli trials required to get a success*

**Resources** : [Negative Binomial distribution & Geometric distribution](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-geometric-distribution-1/tutorial)

### Day 4 : 20 July 2018

**Today's Progress** : Completed 2 problems of Day 5 Challenges

**Thoughts**  : Poisson probability, which is the probability of getting exactly *k* successes when the average number of successes is *lambda*. Poisson Distribution condition, events are occuring randomly and independently.

* [Poisson Distribution](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-poisson-distribution-1/tutorial)

### Day 5 : 21 July 2018

**Today's Progress** : Completed Day 5 Challenges

**Thoughts**  : Normal distribution could have been taught better at Hackerrank. Referred khan academy for better understanding.
* Normal distribution is a function that represents the distribution of many random variables as a symmetrical bell-shaped graph
* Cumulative distributive function is a function which helps to compute the area under curve of probability density function.Eg: It helps in finding probability of getting value less than 'x'.

### Day 6 : 22 July 2018

**Today's Progress** : Completed Day 6 Challenges

**Thoughts** : 
* *Central Limit Theorem*, it states that if you have a population with mean 'mew' and standard deviation 'sigma' and take sufficiently large random samples from the population with replacement , then the distribution of the sample means will be approximately normally distributed.
* *z-score*, it is a factor telling you with what probability you land in an interval of z standard deviations away from the mean (in both directions)

### Day 7 : 23 July 2018

**Today's Progress** : Learnt about Pearson correlation,solved Day 7 question on 10 days of stat and also completed 2 out of 6 section of Conditional probability on Brilliant.org

**Thoughts** : Had fun solving probability problems on brilliant, it is pretty addictive.

### Day 8 : 24 July 2018

**Today's Progress** : Completed Day 7 leftovers and Day 8 challenge,also worked on Brilliant's conditional probability.

**Thoughts** : Solving Linear regression problem was a bliss. But I was stuck in the pearson correlation challenge for regression line, eventually checked the discussion forum.

### Day 10 : 26 July 2018

**Today's Progress** :Initialized udacity's machine learning project. Installed required libraries (scikit-learn, nltk, scipy, numpy and sklearn) and downloaded the dataset. 

**Thoughts** :It seems pretty fun. The course includes 16 lessons and one final project and I Expect to complete it within a month.

**Link of work** : [Commit](https://github.com/qwertypsv/udacity/commits?author=qwertypsv&since=2018-07-25T18:30:00Z&until=2018-07-26T18:30:00Z)

***
### Day 11 : 27 July 2018

**Today's Progress** : Completed Naive bayes assignment, acheived SQL level 4 badge and solved another section brilliants' conditional probability.

**Thoughts** : The assignment seemed pretty intimidating at first but soon it became pretty fun. I will need more practice of advanced queries in order to achieve the final badge at Hackerrank.

### Day 12 : 28 July 2018

**Today's Progress** : Started SVM also solving few probability questions and understanding concepts better.

**Thoughts** : Switched from Time based work to Task based approach it is taking a lot of time but I am indeed delving deep into each topic. Conditional probability helps in deriving an *inference* from *cause - effect* model, pretty much reverse relation.Revised two laws - Multiplicative and Law of total probability.

***
### Day 13 : 29 July 2018


**Today's Progress** : Completed Udacity's SVM and started with Decision Tree,also completed SQL course by Stanford.

**Thoughts** :

* NULL values in database may have unknown behaviour. E.g: while displaying distinct values with null you might get a blank value too, but when you count the distinct values it will skip the null values
* Liked this question many questions from the SQL course, one of those were
```
For all cases where the same reviewer rated the same movie twice and gave it a higher rating the second time, return the reviewer's name and the title of the movie.
```
* Will be soon writing an article covering solutions of SQL - Stanford Online
