# 100DaysOfML
I am taking up the challenge to to Learn  Machine Learning at least an hour everyday!!  

## Daily Log

### Day 0 : 16 July 2018

**Today's Progress** : Completed Day 2 Challenges of "10 Days of Statistics" at Hackerrank

**Thoughts** : Learnt about *Compound*, *Mutually Exclusive* and *Collective Events*. 

**Resources** :

### Day 1 : 17 July 2018

**Today's Progress** : Completed Day 3 Challenges of "10 Days of Statistics" in Hackerrank

**Thoughts** : In *Conditional Probablity*, we are only looking for the probability that the second event occurs in a given state. *Eg:* While tossing a coin twice, probability that you get two heads and the probability that you get head in 2nd toss given that 1st one was a head both are not equal.

### Day 2 : 18 July 2018

**Today's Progress** : Started with *Binomial Distribution* and I think I will hav to put in more time to assimilate the concepts.

**Resources** : 
* [Random Variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variable) 
* [Binomial Experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_trial) 
* [Bernoulli Random Variable and Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_distribution) 
* [Binomial Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution) 
* [Cumulative Probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function).

### Day 3 : 19 July 2018

**Today's Progress** : Completed Hackerrank Day 4 problems.

**Thoughts**  : New concept *The geometric distribution is a *special case* of the negative binomial distribution that deals with the number of Bernoulli trials required to get a success*

**Resources** : [Negative Binomial distribution & Geometric distribution](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-geometric-distribution-1/tutorial)

### Day 4 : 20 July 2018

**Today's Progress** : Completed 2 problems of Day 5 Challenges

**Thoughts**  : Poisson probability, which is the probability of getting exactly *k* successes when the average number of successes is *lambda*. Poisson Distribution conditions, Events are occuring randomly and independently.

### Day 5 : 21 July 2018

**Today's Progress** : Completed Day 5 Challenges

**Thoughts**  : Normal distribution could have been better taught in Hackerrank. Referred khan academy for better understanding

**Resources** : 
* [Poisson Distribution](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-normal-distribution-1/tutorial)
* [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/modeling-distributions-of-data/more-on-normal-distributions/v/introduction-to-the-normal-distribution)
